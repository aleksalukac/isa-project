TIPS: You can see all the appointments in which this MedicalExpert is involved. By clicking the Calendar image on the top,
    you will see the Calendar view of all appointments.
    By clicking Start appointment, all the appointments that are scheduled to happen in this moment will appear and you can either
    start the appointment or mark that user did not show up. System is created in the way that only one appointment can appear here, since
    Medical Expert cannot have two appointments in the same time.
    After starting the appointment, you can write the report and select a drug to prescribe to the patient, along with the length of prescription
    (how long the user should take it). If the user is allergic to certain drugs, they will not appear.
    If you select a drug which is not available in the current Pharmacy, Pharmacy Admin will be informed about the absence of the certain drug.
    If user is not allergic to the substitute druge and if it is available in the pharmacy, user will automatically be given the substitute drug and
    you will be informed about this.
    After finishing the appointment, you will be offered to schedule another appointment for this user.
